## Research interests
My particular interest lies in investigating dynamic processes in active galactic nuclei and the formation 
and evolution of (super-) massive black holes, approached from both observational and theoretical per
spectives. I am especially fascinated by the role of extreme objects, such as quasars, in cosmic structure 
formation and galaxy evolution.
